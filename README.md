#Installation recomendation for Windows

First download the Kunstdatenbank folder,
save it somewhere you will know where it is.

Best way to use program is create a shortcut of Kunstdatenbank Application. (that is file with icon of purple database)
(To create shortcut right click on it, then click create shortcut).
Then you can drag shortcut file to desktop

I suggest doing the same with folder Kunstwerks_fotos, but instead to desktop,
 I would add it into picture folder in file explorer.
